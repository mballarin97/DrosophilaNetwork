# DrosophilaNetwork
Network science analysis of the drosophila structural connectome.
In particular, the work focuses on:
- A coarse graining technique to reduce the size of the system. The evolution of different metrics through the reduction;
- An analysis of the different neural communities;
- An analysis of the robustness of the network.
