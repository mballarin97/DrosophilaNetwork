In this work we will analyze the hemibrane of a Drosophila, commonly called “small fruit fly”.
This analysis will be fascinating since we will apply all the techniques proper of the 
network science field to a neural connectome, thus connecting two fields that can really 
benefit of each others. One of the most challenging section of this project will be handling
the dataset, since it amounts of more than $2\cdot10^{4}$ neurons and $2\cdot10^6$ synapses.
We will so develop a technique to reduce the network size, monitoring important quantities. 
We will then analyze the robustness of the network and its evolution along the 
procedure.
Finally, we will pose particular interest in the analysis of the communities, trying to understand 
if we are able to distinguish the different macro-areas of the brain.
